    <h2>Caracteristic of the Cat</h2>
    <h3>Breeds and Body Size</h3>
    <p>
        There are many different breeds of cats, including Abyssinian, Himalayan, Maine Coon, Manx, Persian, Scottish Fold, and Siamese, to name a few. The Cat Fanciers’ Association, which is the world’s largest registry of pedigreed cats, recognizes about 40 distinct breeds.
    </p>
    <h3>Metabolism</h3>
    <p>
        Cats also share the rapid metabolism that dogs have, which results in a higher heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature than those of people (see Table: Normal Feline Physiologic Values). Cats generally live longer than dogs, and many live to be 20 years old or older
    </p>
    <h3>The Senses</h3>
    <p>
        Cats have the same 5 senses as people do but to very different degrees. Some senses are much better developed than in people.
